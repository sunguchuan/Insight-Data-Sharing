# NEAR version of the application.
## How to run the test
### Upload file to IPFS
With connection to an IPFS node, upload your file and get IPFS hash.
### Copy the link to your browser and run
Go to the link of NEAR studio and click "run" on the top. Click "OK" to the fork-option pop-out.
### Sign-in with your NEAR account
Click "Sign-in with NEAR". Then choose the account of the key sender and click "allow". 
If you don't have a NEAR account, you need to register two by clicking "create new account". One account acts as key holder and the other acts as data holder.
### Share the public key
In the first block, input the user name that you want to share your key with and your public key, then click "Register!".
### Get the public key
Switch user to the data holder by clicking "Sign out". In the second block, input the key holder's user name and click "Get the key!". If you pass the access confirmation, the shared public key should show up right below the input.
### Share the data
After encryping your IPFS hash in local with the public key, input the cipher to the third block with the key holder's user name to the corresponding fields. Click "Share your data!"
### Get the data
Switch account to the key holder. In the last block, input the data holder's user name and click "Get the data!". If you pass the access confirmation, the shared data should show up right below the input.
### Download file from IPFS
After decrypting the cipher with private key to the IPFS hash, you can download the file from IPFS.
