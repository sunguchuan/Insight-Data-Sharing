# Insight-Data-Sharing

As the data in smart contracts are public, people take risks when they are transmitting sensitive information through smart contracts because malicious users can steal the information by monitoring the channels and blockchains. My project aims at enabling secure sensitive information transmission through public smart contracts. The solution is to encrypt the information before transmission to make it uninterpretable to other users.
